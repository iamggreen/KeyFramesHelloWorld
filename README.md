**CSS KeyFrames**

I am trying to learn about keyframes and I followed [this tutorial](http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/05/17/an-introduction-to-css3-keyframe-animations/).  Also, the prefixes needed to make keyframes working are super annoying so I also tried out Grunt and Sass mixins to make the pain go away.
